# Introduction

 The (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/) estimates that approximately 20 milllion women and 10 million men in the United States will face and eating disorder sometime during their lifetime. 
 With that, in this blog I will discuss demographics, what eating disorders are and how they are defined, their signs/symptoms, potential causes for disordered eating, and the recovery process. 
 You are not alone in this process, and RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE.
