# Topic Submission
The focus and the concept of my blog will be to focus on eating disorders. I will explain what eating disorders are, how they are defined, their demographics, signs and symptoms, potential causes, and the recovery process. Each post will be one of the topics mentioned above (some may be grouped together). 
I will be using the National Eating Disorder Association for specific information so it is a credible resource.
I will be attempting to use GitHub Pages.
